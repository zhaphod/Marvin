Marvin
======

Marvin is a simple bit-torrent client written in Python. The aim of the project is to learn Python programming and software design. Developing a full fledged client that supports all the features found in more established clients is not the goal. The main goals are:

* Creating clean and simple software architecture
* Creating robust APIs
* Learn and master Python programming
* Learn network programming
* Learn multi-threaded programming

Bit-torrent protocol is a simple protocol yet provides a significant challenge that one can learn a lot by implementing it. Furthermore there are many well written, open source clients available which will be useful in overcoming any significant roadblocks.

### Bit-torrent specification ###

The following documents are important to develop the client:

- [Official specification] (<http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0000.html>)

- [Theory.org spec with more details] (<https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification>)


### Docs ###

TBD

### Collaboration ###

Right now this project is an individual effort. Depending on the progress contributions can be accepted at later stage.

### Roadmap ###

* Create bencode library
* Implement tracker communication
* Implement download of a single torrent file
